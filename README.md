# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a collection of different implementations of Fundamental Data Structures and some basic algorithm. 

Each folder introduces you to the core features of the language and some basic implementation to get started. 
A basic implementation of data structures is provided in the `Structure` section. 

---
Data Structures - these will be implemented both in a simple version and using `generic programming` for flexibility. 

- Vectors
- Linked Lists
    - Singly linked-list
    - Doubly linked-list
    - Circular linked-list
- Stacks
    - Static stack
    - Dynamic stack
- Queues
    - Static Queue
        - circular queue

    - AVL Tree
    - Red-black Tree
- Graphs
    - Vanilla implementations of graphs

Algorithms
- Searching
    - Linear Search
