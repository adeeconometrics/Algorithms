## Notes on C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985. It has been widely used ever since then for C++ gives you the ability for working closely with the metal and expressing very high-level abstractions using `templates`. It has widely used for systems programming, game engine programming, operating systems, scientific computations, and embedded systems to name a few.

Notable features:
- High-performance computing
- template meta-programming
- Constructors and Destructors for RAII
- Works very closely with the metal while expressive enough to write high-level abstraction
